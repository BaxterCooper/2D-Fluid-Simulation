# 2D-Fluid-Simulation

A 2D fluid simulation inspired by Jos Stam's paper [Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Fall09/papers/StamFluidforGames.pdf) and Mike Ash's thesis [Fluid Simulation for Dummies](https://mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html).

For an inspirational video on the physics and concepts used in this simulation please watch Gonkee's [But How DO Fluid Simulations Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qsYE1wMEMPA) video.
